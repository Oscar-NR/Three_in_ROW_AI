# Three_in_ROW_AI

WORK IN PROGRESS

This is my first project in Python, and it will consist in 3 classes, one which take care about the interface, this is the less important file, a second one which will be the core of the game (will figure if a player has winned), and the last class will be a artificial intellegence which should be unbeatable and will try to win.
